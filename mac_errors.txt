The Apple Hardware Test (AHT) is now built into the ROM (just like the latest iMac). Hold down the 'D' key at boot time and it boots into AHT.
The previous version had AHT on the system install DVD. If you wanted to run AHT, you needed the disc. Now you don't.

On startup (press and hold key on start up)
	'd' - Apple Hardware Test (AHT)
	'option' - able to select the boot drive
	'option-command-p-r' - Reset NVRAM (you will hear two beeps before you release the keys)
	'n' - Attempt to start up from a compatible network server (NetBoot)
	't' - Start up in FireWire Target Disk mode.
	'shift' - Start up in Safe Boot mode and temporarily disable login items.
	'v' - Start up in Verbose mode.
	's' - Start up in Single-User mode.
