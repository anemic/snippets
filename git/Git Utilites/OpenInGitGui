To install, http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?q=label:Featured, and extract to /Applications/Scripts (you'll need to create the Scripts directory, likely). Then, find the icon, and drag it up to your toolbar. Keep it there for a few seconds until it "sticks".

To use, open finder to a folder with a git repository, and click the "Git" icon.
