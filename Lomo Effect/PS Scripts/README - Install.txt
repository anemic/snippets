Put the script in the following location in your Photoshop directory: [PS Directory]/Presets/Scripts
(~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop CS4/Presets/Scripts)

Installation Help:

When you click on the links it will show you the actual commands of the script. These are written in Javascript, but you don't really need to know that. When you click on it and see the script just go to your File menu and select Save As. Then save it as a useful name somewhere on your computer (the best place is under your Photoshop directory in the Presets->Scripts directory so that they will show up in the scripts menu automatically).

Once they are saved you can run them on an image from Photoshop by going to File->Scripts->Browse... (or, if you installed them in the above location then they will just show up in the Scripts menu already).

Oh...you'll have to restart PS before they will show up in the menu. If you put them somewhere else on your drive and use the Browse... method then no PS restart is required.
