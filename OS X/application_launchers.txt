Sapiens ($19.95)
Smart launcher which learns which programs you use most. You’ll get used to the mnemonic way it displays programs on its circular interface for fast launching.

ExpressLauncher ($15.00)
In this one I really enjoy the interface, however to be honest it’s essentially a preferences pane item that associates keys with apps.

Docktop ($6.00)
This one is like a new and improved Dock that you can customize at will. It can be cloned and moved anywhere on your screen so you have different docks for different needs.

Snard ($10.00)
Nostalgic of the good old file explorer view? Snard makes it available straight from your menu bar, so any app is only a few mouse movements away.

Quicksilver (free)
Before Spotlight turned up, Quicksilver was the most cherished app of Mac geeks the world around. A powerful and fast multi-app launcher with keystroke support.

Valet ($25.00)
Like Bruce Wayne, imagine you had Alfred around to remember everything you needed and launched on your Mac. This is what Valet will do for you (it won’t get you a Batmobile though)

Todos (free)
This app is the ancestor of Leopard’s grid view. Type a hotkey and Todos will bring up a full grid of all your applications for you.

Namely (free)
Like Spotlight but want to limit it to apps? You can configure it from the preferences. Or you can install Namely. Less hassle.
